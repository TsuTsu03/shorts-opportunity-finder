# Engagement Scoring Factors

Your algorithm should consider these factors when scoring clips for short-form content potential.

## High-Value Indicators (+)

### Duration (Weight: High)
- **Sweet Spot**: 30-90 seconds
- **Too Short**: < 30 seconds (incomplete thoughts, lacks context)
- **Too Long**: > 90 seconds (attention span drops, harder to watch through)
- **Scoring Guidance**: 30-60 seconds = excellent, 60-90 = good, outside range = penalize

### Content Hooks (Weight: Very High)
- **Questions**: Ending with "?" creates curiosity ("Why do founders fail?")
- **Controversial Statements**: Strong opinions that spark debate
- **Secrets/Reveals**: "Here's what nobody tells you..."
- **Shocking Stats**: Unexpected numbers or percentages
- **Common Mistakes**: "The biggest mistake I see..."

### Action Words (Weight: Medium)
Strong verbs that create urgency or importance:
- never, always, must, should, need to
- mistake, problem, issue, challenge
- secret, truth, reality, fact
- best, worst, greatest, terrible

### Numbers & Specificity (Weight: Medium)
- **Specific Numbers**: "3 ways", "80% of companies", "$10M"
- **Steps/Lists**: "First...", "Second...", "Finally..."
- **Statistics**: Percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes
- **Concrete Examples**: Named companies, products, people

### Completeness (Weight: High)
- **Complete Thoughts**: Starts and ends at natural breaks
- **Proper Endings**: Ends with period, exclamation, or question mark
- **No Cut-offs**: Doesn't end mid-sentence or mid-thought
- **Context**: Has enough setup to be understood standalone

### Emotion & Opinion (Weight: Medium)
- **Strong Opinions**: "This is terrible", "This is brilliant"
- **Passion**: Emphatic language, exclamations
- **Controversy**: Takes a side, challenges conventional wisdom
- **Personal Stories**: First-person experiences, anecdotes

### Actionability (Weight: Medium)
- **How-To**: Explains a process or solution
- **Tips/Advice**: Gives specific recommendations
- **Frameworks**: Provides mental models or approaches
- **Warnings**: What to avoid, mistakes to prevent

## Low-Value Indicators (-)

### Generic Content
- Introductions and outros
- "Thanks for having me" pleasantries
- Sponsor reads and advertisements
- Host transitions ("Let's dive in")

### Incomplete Thoughts
- Cuts off mid-explanation
- Lacks context without the surrounding conversation
- Too much inside baseball/jargon without explanation
- Requires knowledge of earlier conversation

### Too Technical Without Context
- Dense jargon without explanation
- Complex concepts with no analogies
- Assumes too much technical knowledge
- Database/API specifics without broader context

### Rambling or Unfocused
- No clear point or takeaway
- Multiple topics without connection
- Too many tangents
- Stream of consciousness without structure

## Scoring Examples

### Perfect Clip (90-100 points)
**Example**: 45-second segment with:
- Controversial take on common practice
- Starts with a question
- Contains specific statistics
- Ends with complete thought
- Strong action words throughout

**Text**: "Why do most startups waste 80% of their engineering time? Here's the truth nobody talks about: they're solving the wrong problems. I've seen teams build perfect features that customers never asked for. The biggest mistake? Obsessing over your code quality before you even know if people want your product."

### Good Clip (70-89 points)
**Example**: 60-second segment with:
- Clear advice or insight
- Some numbers or specifics
- Complete thought
- Missing the hook or controversy

**Text**: "When you're building a product, focus on three things: stability, documentation, and only then scale. I learned this the hard way. We tried to scale before stabilizing, and it cost us months of rework. Get the foundation right first."

### Okay Clip (50-69 points)
**Example**: 75-second segment with:
- Interesting but longer than ideal
- Somewhat generic advice
- Complete but rambles a bit

**Text**: "So in my experience, what I've found is that working with different teams and organizations, communication is really important. You need to make sure everyone understands what's happening, and that means documentation and meetings and making sure people are aligned..."

### Poor Clip (0-49 points)
**Example**: 20-second fragment or 120-second ramble:
- Too short or too long
- Incomplete thought
- Generic or boring content
- No hook or value proposition

## Weighting Recommendations

Consider weighting factors roughly like this:
- Duration Optimization: 25-30%
- Content Hooks: 25-30%
- Completeness: 15-20%
- Actionability: 10-15%
- Numbers/Specificity: 10-15%
- Emotion/Opinion: 5-10%

**Important**: These are guidelines, not rules. Feel free to weight differently based on your analysis of what makes engaging content!

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Multi-segment clips**: Should you combine consecutive segments?
2. **Speaker changes**: Are back-and-forth exchanges engaging or confusing?
3. **Context dependency**: Can the clip stand alone?
4. **Audience knowledge**: Does it require too much background?
5. **Platform differences**: TikTok vs YouTube Shorts vs Instagram Reels

## Final Notes

- No single factor guarantees success
- Context matters - a technical clip might work for a technical audience
- The best clips often have 3-4 strong factors working together
- Err on the side of completeness over cutting for perfect length
- When in doubt, ask: "Would I stop scrolling to watch this?"
